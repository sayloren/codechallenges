# The Collatz conjecture states that, for any positive integer n, 
# it will eventually reach 1 by repeatedly applying the following procedure:

#     If n is even, divide it by 2.
#     If n is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.

# The number of steps needed for n to reach 1 is called its stopping time. For example, the stopping time of 10 is six:

# 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

# Print the stopping times of all the numbers from 1 to 1,000 inclusive, each on their own line. 

import sys

# Printing
print('Hello, World!')

# Looping
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# Accessing arguments
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    print(arg)
